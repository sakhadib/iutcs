### Social Media and Digital Platforms
IUTCS has expanded their digital presence beyond traditional platforms. They maintain an active presence on itch.io, where they organize gaming events and hackathons[4]. Their itch.io profile confirms their organizational mission and provides detailed information about their nine operational teams and six major annual event categories[4].

In 2021, IUTCS organized the "Brain Station 23 presents Hack-A-Jam 2021," a groundbreaking 5-day game development hackathon with a total prize pool of 70,000 BDT. This was the first university-level game jam in Bangladesh, demonstrating IUTCS's innovation in introducing new competition formats[5].


### Industry Collaboration and Research Partnerships

**Bengali.AI Collaboration**: In 2024, IUTCS established a significant partnership with Bengali.AI for a regional dialect datathon[10]. This collaboration was personally facilitated by Md. Rezuwan Hassan, who highlighted that IUTCS reached out directly to propose hosting a national-level deep learning competition on their campus[10]. The dataset utilized in this datathon was developed from large-scale research projects focused on Bengali speech recognition technology across ten geographical locations[10].

**NetCom Learning Partnership**: In 2025, IUTCS partnered with NetCom Learning Bangladesh for Agent X, described as "Bangladesh's largest national AI Prompting Competition"[11]. This partnership involves multiple IEEE organizations and provides students with opportunities to gain Microsoft certifications, AI+ Prompt Engineering skills, and AI Agent Creation experience[11].

## Employment Outcomes and Industry Impact

### Graduate Employment Statistics
Research indicates that IUT graduates, many of whom are IUTCS members, enjoy exceptional employment outcomes[12]. According to a 2018 Asian Development Bank tracer study, IUT graduates achieved:
- Job placement rate exceeding 90%
- Highest mean salary among surveyed universities at Tk51,938
- Strong performance in both private sector employment and further education[12]

The study noted that "graduates of the Islamic University of Technology (IUT) and the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) found it easier to land jobs" and emphasized that "the high job placement rate indicates a strong demand for CSE/IIT graduates who are considered the human capital backbone of the information technology and information technology-enabled services (IT/ITES) industry development in the country"[12].

### Facebook Presence Limitations
Unfortunately, direct access to IUTCS's Facebook page was not possible due to platform authentication requirements. However, evidence suggests they maintain active social media presence across multiple platforms including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Discord, as referenced in their event announcements and gaming competitions[5].

### Digital Innovation and Platform Diversification
IUTCS has demonstrated innovation in digital platform utilization through their itch.io presence and game development initiatives[4][5]. Their organization of the first university-level game jam in Bangladesh represents their commitment to exploring emerging technology areas and providing students with diverse skill development opportunities[5].

## Organizational Evolution and Current Status

The society has evolved from its original seven-committee structure to a more comprehensive nine-team organization:

**Current Nine Teams**[4]:
1. Administration
2. Event Management  
3. Operations
4. Publications & Content Writing
5. Logistics and Design
6. Public Relations
7. Sponsorship and Liaison
8. Photography, Video Editing, Graphics
